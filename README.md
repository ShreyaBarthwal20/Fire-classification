# Fire-classification
AICET Internship
Fire Classification using MODIS Data: The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can classify fire events by analyzing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data. The model will identify and categorize wildfire occurrences, enabling better monitoring and management of fire-related events across different regions.
